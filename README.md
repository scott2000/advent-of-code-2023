# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023]. This year, I am using [Roc],
a promising new functional programming language. Since it is still in development,
there will likely be breaking changes, so this code may not work in the future.

A few parts were too difficult to do in Roc because of package availability, so
I did those parts in [Rust] instead. One part also requires [Z3] to be installed.
